### Getting Started

  * Follow the [getting started guide](./docs/getting-started.md) to download and run the project
    ([node](https://nodejs.org/) >= 5,
    **[node-gyp](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#readme)**
    and **[prerequisites](https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#installation)**)
  * Check the [code recipes](./docs/recipes) used in this boilerplate, or share yours


### Customization

The `master` branch of React Starter Kit doesn't include a Flux implementation or any other
advanced integrations. Nevertheless, we have some integrations available to you in *feature*
branches that you can use either as a reference or merge into your project:

  * [feature/redux](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/redux) — isomorphic
    Redux by [Pavel Lang](https://github.com/langpavel)
    (see [how to integrate Redux](./docs/recipes/how-to-integrate-redux.md)) (based on `master`)
  * [feature/react-intl](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/react-intl) —
    isomorphic Redux and React Intl by [Pavel Lang](https://github.com/langpavel)
    (see [how to integrate React Intl](./docs/recipes/how-to-integrate-react-intl.md)) (based on `feature/redux`)
  * [feature/bootstrap3](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/bootstrap3) —
    Simplest possible integration of [react-bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
    by [Pavel Lang](https://github.com/langpavel) (based on `master`)

If you think that any of these features should be on `master`, or vice versa, some features should
removed from the `master` branch, please [let us know](https://gitter.im/kriasoft/react-starter-kit).
We love your feedback!
